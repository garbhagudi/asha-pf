                    We all want happiness and success and keep chasing both
                    throughout our lives. However, only 4-5 per cent of people
                    in the entire world end up becoming successful and from
                    among them less than 1 per cent become successful and happy.
                    What is the secret power that propels these people to the
                    top of the pyramid? What makes them who they are?

                    Author Megha Bajaj set out on a journey and visited
                    different parts of the country and discovered 11 such
                    individuals who were truly happy and successful. She
                    realized that in a country of 1.3 billion people these
                    individuals had one thing in common—they had the rare
                    ability to turn an ordinary event into a significant one and
                    then turn that into a ‘breakthrough’.

                    They seize the moment when there is nothing perceptible to
                    seize; they look at the present and create a future; they
                    realize that the Supreme Power is always there, only if one
                    believes unfailingly, surrenders completely and works
                    tirelessly. Meet Nitin, Asha, Arun, Chitra, Sandeep, Kanni,
                    Uvaraj, Guru, Kavish, Mukesh, Praburam and Sushiil.

                    If you want to find excitement in the ordinary; To realize
                    that you need to keep moving regardless of success or
                    failure; To ask yourself: When was the last time you did
                    something for the first time?; To understand why each human
                    being is a co-creator of his or her own destiny; To find out
                    why even the sky is not enough for your imagination; To
                    accept the fact that life will keep jumping at you and keep
                    saying, ‘Surprise!’; To learn how to get rid of desperation
                    and let everything just happen; To realize that results may
                    be delayed, but never denied; To discover that the answer to
                    all your troubles lies within you; To keep expanding your
                    Life Mantra; To keep learning.
